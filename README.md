# articles-angular
Articles is a small app where registered users can upload articles about whatever they want.

The user can watch an article board, create articles, edit, delete, sign in, sign up, logout.

This app is built with Angular 4, but it'll also have a ReactJs and React Native version.

Worried about Angular 5? Don't panic this code still works with it due to the major changes in the latest Angular version are internally.

Why?

1) It's a great resource for developers that are looking for nice working examples about the frontend technologies mentioned before.

2) I've been learning those technologies since a while but I hadn't done something cool with it. So here it is, and of course, it'll be part of my portfolio.

What are you going to find on "articles-angular"?

- And much much more!
